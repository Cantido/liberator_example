# Liberator Example

This library demonstrates how to use the [Liberator] library to create controllers that respect the HTTP specificiation.

[Liberator]: https://github.com/Cantido/liberator

## Install

Clone this library using Git.

## Usage

This library is built as a standard Phoenix application, so use `mix phx.server` to start it.

There is no HTTP/webpack component of this library, since Liberator is best used for APIs.

## Contributing

Questions and pull requests are more than welcome.
I follow Elixir's tenet of bad documentation being a bug,
so if anything is unclear, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Cantido/liberator_example/issues/new)!
Ideally, my answer to your question will be in an update to the docs.
